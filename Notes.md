## To-Discuss:
- MVP has same results for all configurations
- linking cells does not work (for me atleast)
- Adding new data seems to reduce the dataset as there are lot of NANs.



## TO DO:
- Add error in the library imports if wrds name is not defined. 
- A folder in which all the output data is stored.
